		<h2 class="mb-4">Me</h2>
		<p class="mb-4">
		  Hi:) thanks for clicking around. A bit about me...
		<p>
		  I'm a fifth year grad student at the University of Illinois where I came after doing my undergrad at the University of Michigan.
		  I'm originally from the Thumb of Michigan where I grew up loving the Great Lakes (did you know that Michigan has 3288 miles of shoreline? That's more than any state except Alaska, wild). 
		  These days, I don't get to see much of Lake Huron, but I take any chance I can to get outside, spending lots of time climbing in Southern Illinois. I also enjoy making kombucha 
		</p>
                <h2 class="mb-4">Research</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  High energy pheno is a super broad topic which encompasses studies of models for new physics and how we might 
                  observe effects of those models. I work specifically on models for dark sector physics --- physics which 
                  interacts weakly with Standard Model photons --- including dark matter and gravitational waves.
                <p>
                  Since the late 1800s, physicists have known that the matter we interact with through the Standard Model does 
                  not constitute a majority of the energy in the Universe. In fact, it makes up only about 4% of it. All things considered, that's pretty wild. The remaining 
                  96% of the energy is split into dark matter and dark energy, and determining the nature of these dark sectors is 
                  a fundamental goal of elementary particle physics. I work on solving 27% of that mystery by developing methods 
                  to search for dark matter, a component of matter that interacts weakly (or doesn't interact at all) with electromagnetism. 
                  In particular, I've worked on axion detection using superconducting radiofrequency cavities, potential high-
                  frequency gravitational wave detectors that could search for dark matter signals from primordial black holes or 
                  superradiance, and proper treatment of muon radiation at a muon collider.
                </p>
		<h2 class="mb-4">Muon Colliders</h2>
		<p class="mb-4">
		  It turns out that one of the best ways to look for new physics is by taking physics that we understand, juicing it up with energy, and then smashing it.
		  The Large Hadron Collider is a perfect example of this technique. At the LHC, scientists take protons (which we understand how to deal with) and accelerate
		  them until they're travelling at 99.999999% the speed of light. Then they smash those protons into other protons. The result is a spectacular explosion of
		  physics at the highest energies we can probe. This process was how the Higgs boson was discovered in 2012, and it has been how we've discovered tons of new
		  particles throughout the last century. And while smashing protons into protons is good fun and has lead to lots of interesting science, smashing other
		  particles could potentially be even more fun, so we should consider trying it.
		<p>
		  A muon collider aims to do just that, accelerate muons and smash them into each other. Muons are a more massive version of an electron (about 200 times more massive than an electron or 10 times less massive than a proton), and there are a couple of reasons why they might be better than protons for smashing purposes. First, muons are fundamental particles whereas protons are composite. Essentially what that means is that when you're smashing protons, you're really only smashing part of a proton with part of another proton meaning that you're only smashing things at a fraction of the energy you accelerated them to. Muons are fundemental and thus have no "parts." That means that when you smash muons together, you get the most bang for your buck. Second, when particles are circularly accelerated, they radiate photons through synchrotron radiation, losing some of their energy. More massive particles are less inhibitted by synchrotron radiation meaning that muons are much better accelerator candidates than electrons. Third, based on the first two points, muon colliders are the most environmentally conscious collider. While colliders do not have high emissions relative to other human endeavors (the LHC emits about as much carbon as a single cruise ship each year), it is still incredibly important to mitigate the negative side effects of probing the boundaries of human knowledge. After all, what's the point of studying nature if we destroy it in the process. Each of these reasons is a compelling argument for a muon collider, but it is the fourth and final reason that I study: the radiation of muons at high energies.
		<p>
		  While we don't want muons to radiate too much, some radiation can be beneficial. It turns out that at high enough energies, muons start to radiate photons, W bosons, Z bosons, and all other Standard Model particles. These particles can also collide with each other implying that a muon collider is also a collider of other exotic particles. Studying the collisions of the radiated particles can help us understand the nature of dark matter, the subtle physics of the Higgs boson, and probe other untested new physics models. In order to probe all this cool science, we need to understand the physics of the radiated particles, and that is what I work on. For a more thorough explanation, look for upcoming papers.
